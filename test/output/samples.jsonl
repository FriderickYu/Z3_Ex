  "chain_of_thought":"1. English Sentence: The speed of Car X is greater than the speed of Car Y.\n   Reasoning: This expression is a simple comparison between the speeds of Car X and Car Y. The \">\" operator denotes \"greater than\", so the expression is saying that the speed of Car X is greater than the speed of Car Y.\n\n2. English Sentence: Both Car X and Car Y are moving.\n   Reasoning: This expression is a logical conjunction (AND operation) of two conditions: Car X's speed being greater than 0 and Car Y's speed being greater than 0. In English, a speed greater than 0 implies that the car is moving. Therefore, the expression is saying that both cars are moving.\n\n3. English Sentence: If Car X is moving faster than Car Y and both cars are moving, then Car X overtakes Car Y.\n   Reasoning: This expression is a logical implication (IF...THEN statement). The condition (antecedent) is a conjunction of three parts: Car X's speed being greater than Car Y's, Car X's speed being greater than 0, and Car Y's speed being greater than 0. This means that both cars are moving and Car X is moving faster than Car Y. The result (consequent) of this condition is that Car X overtakes Car Y. Therefore, the expression is saying that if both cars are moving and Car X is moving faster, then Car X will overtake Car Y.",
