You are an expert LSAT question designer specializing in formal logic reasoning. Your task is to create a high-quality logical reasoning question that requires multi-step inference following the exact logical rules provided.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Use ALL provided variables in a coherent, single-domain scenario
2. The reasoning must follow the EXACT logical chain specified
3. The correct answer can ONLY be derived by following ALL steps in sequence
4. Generate realistic scenarios that naturally embody the logical relationships

**Input Elements:**

Z3 Logical Rules:
{z3_exprs}

Variable Semantic Bindings:
{var_bindings}

Multi-Step Reasoning Chain:
{logical_steps}

**Detailed Instructions:**

**1. SCENARIO CREATION:**
- Create a realistic scenario within ONE semantic domain (academic, business, legal, medical, or certification)
- Every variable must play a meaningful role in the scenario
- The scenario should naturally set up the logical conditions without feeling artificial
- Include specific names, roles, places, and concrete details
- Ensure the scenario provides all information needed for the complete reasoning chain

**2. LOGICAL CHAIN IMPLEMENTATION:**
- The reasoning must require following ALL steps in the provided logical sequence
- Each step should build upon previous conclusions
- No shortcuts should lead to the correct answer
- The final conclusion should only be reachable through the complete chain

**3. ANSWER CHOICES DESIGN:**
- Choice A-D must include exactly one logically valid conclusion
- Include these specific distractor types:
  * One that represents incomplete reasoning (using only part of the chain)
  * One that reverses the logical direction (affirming consequent/denying antecedent)
  * One that introduces unrelated but plausible information
- All distractors should be tempting but logically invalid

**4. QUESTION FORMULATION:**
- Ask what can be "validly concluded" or "logically inferred"
- Use precise logical language
- Ensure the question requires deductive rather than inductive reasoning

**Output Format - JSON Only:**

```json
{{
  "context": "A detailed, realistic scenario that naturally incorporates all variables and sets up the logical relationships. Should be 3-5 sentences establishing the complete situation.",

  "question": "What can be validly concluded from the given information?",

  "answers": [
    "A. [Correct answer - derivable only through complete reasoning chain]",
    "B. [Distractor - incomplete reasoning]",
    "C. [Distractor - reversed logic]",
    "D. [Distractor - plausible but unrelated]"
  ],

  "label": "[A/B/C/D - letter of correct answer]",

  "z3": [
    "[All variable declarations using semantic names]",
    "[All logical implications as Z3 expressions]"
  ]
}}
```

**Quality Checklist (ensure all points are met):**
✓ All variables from the binding list are meaningfully used
✓ Scenario belongs to a single, coherent semantic domain
✓ Logical relationships are naturally embedded in the context
✓ Correct answer requires following the complete reasoning chain
✓ Distractors represent specific logical fallacies
✓ Z3 expressions accurately represent the logical structure
✓ Question tests deductive reasoning skills

**Example of High-Quality Output:**

```json
{{
  "context": "At Riverside University, the Computer Science Department has established clear requirements for graduate program admission. Students must complete both the advanced algorithms course AND submit a research proposal to qualify for the candidacy exam. Furthermore, students who pass the candidacy exam AND achieve a GPA above 3.7 are automatically accepted into the PhD program. The department also guarantees that any student accepted into the PhD program will receive full funding for their studies.",

  "question": "If Maria completed the advanced algorithms course, submitted her research proposal, passed her candidacy exam, and achieved a 3.8 GPA, what can be validly concluded?",

  "answers": [
    "A. Maria will receive full funding for her PhD studies",
    "B. Maria qualified for the candidacy exam but may not be accepted to the PhD program",
    "C. Maria completed the course requirements but did not submit a research proposal",
    "D. Maria will be accepted to the PhD program but funding is not guaranteed"
  ],

  "label": "A",

  "z3": [
    "completed_algorithms = Bool('completed_algorithms')",
    "submitted_proposal = Bool('submitted_proposal')",
    "qualified_candidacy = Bool('qualified_candidacy')",
